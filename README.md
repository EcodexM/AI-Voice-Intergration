# AI-Voice-Intergration
Stop chatting start talking to Chat GPT


This python file contains three algorithns]

1. Voice-to-text SpeechRecognition
2. API request to Open-ai gtp-3
3. text-to-voice 

It accepts voice commands in form of questions and changes the voice commands to text.
It then issue an api request to open-ai gpt-3 passing the text as the input. Then says the returned json data back to you.

gives an impression of coversation with an ai.
still laggy I am sure there are some improvements that can be done to make it faster.
open to suggestions.
